## üß† Problem Statement
The objective is to explore and model bike-sharing patterns using:
- **Regression models** to predict continuous outcomes such as pollutant concentration levels (`PU_ct`, `DO_ct`)
- **Classification models** to predict categorical outcomes
- **Regularization & Cross-Validation techniques** to improve model generalization and select optimal model complexity

## üìä Techniques Applied

### ‚úÖ 1. Regression Modeling
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Lasso and Ridge Regression
- Evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R¬≤ score**

### ‚úÖ 2. Classification Tasks
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifiers (Linear and RBF kernel)
- Model comparison based on **accuracy scores**

### ‚úÖ 3. Model Regularization and Cross Validation
- Applied **Lasso Regression** with:
  - Coefficient path visualization
  - GridSearchCV and LassoCV for best hyperparameter (`alpha`) selection
  - Cross-validated performance metrics
- Out-of-sample MSE evaluation for model robustness

## üìà Highlights
- Feature scaling and dummy encoding handled appropriately
- Lasso Regularization helped identify the most impactful predictors
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation ensured optimal model performance
- Visualized how regularization affects feature selection

## üìÅ File Structure
- `ML_Supervised.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with all analysis
- `README.md` - Project overview

## üìå Conclusion
This project showcases a complete supervised machine learning workflow from data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning to model evaluation using real-world data. It demonstrates strong foundations in regression, classification, and regularization using Python and Scikit-learn.
